The K2Test is a series of classes written to create a low grade test harness 
for the K2Verity Platform. The system allows for multithreaded test execution
with source queries and search queries. The search and source queries are also
randomized to provide variablity in execution as well as to minimize caching
on the Verity back end servers.
